- Louise feedback

**Positive:**
It wa soverall an positive experience, and a fun working in a team like that.  

**Team Collaboration and Size:** 5 was a good size, easy to keep track and work togheter.

**Strength:** Our team size and our different experiences and skills! One was good at frontend, one with the terminal, one with figma, one with Github and so on. We tried to use that to our advantage.

**Agile Methodology:** Was a fun and for us good way to work, we could try different approches and easy switch if we felt it did not work out well or gave the result we wanted.

**Communication Within the Team:** We used Discord server with a GitBot connected to it and verybody wa s active there more or less. Sometimes you did not get answers in the chat but we had frequent meetings where we could discuss everthing also the questions raised in the chat.

**Concern:** Some communication problems, some language barriärs and that we all where on different technical levels lead to some issue handling within the group, but it was good prctise to learn and overcome this.
