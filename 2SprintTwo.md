## Meeting wednesday 1 nov 12:00

My suggestion are:

Github: One main, one test (keep as it is)

On main we can have a style.scss and a _design.scss, so we all can access those.

- Style has @import (the other sides)  and #reset.

- _design has $colors and headlines and fonts.

Test is weÂ´re we push our branches, and maybe in a week or two we see if everything works we push to main.

And important to know we cant use javascript, the main goal is to show we can redesign so we can have a dropdown that does not work, a search window that does not work and so on, just for design. Beacuse those function needs javascript to function good, but we include them in the design for good look.
